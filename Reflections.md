<h2> What was the challenge? </h2>

The challenge was to create Jenkins pipeline which tests the app, builds the image and pushes it to the Nexus Repository

<h2> How I expected the challenge to go </h2>

I expected the challenge to be tough as I did not know how to test the app. But other then tetsing the app, the challenge was good. 

<h2>  What went well? </h2>

I managed to complete the challenge successfully but I did come acroos sonme issues with pushing the files to Github. Also, I developed my programming skills as I now i'm able to confidently use Bash comamands and work with scripts.
