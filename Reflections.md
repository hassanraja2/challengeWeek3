<h2> What was the challenge? </h2>

The challenge was to create Jenkins pipeline which tests the app, builds the image and pushes it to the Nexus Repository

<h2> How I expected the challenge to go </h2>

I expected the challenge to be tough as I did not know how to test the app. But other then tetsing the app, the challenge was good. 

<h2>  What went well? </h2>

I managed to complete the challenge successfully but I did come acroos some issues with pushing the files to Github. Also, i've developed my programming skills as I now able to confidently use Bash comamands and work with scripts.

<h2> What didn't go as planned? </h2>

I was having issues with Github as I was trying to upload the files into my repository, but in the end I managed to fix the problem. 

<h2> Improvements for future challenges </h2>

I feelk like I need to practice more with working with virtual environments on bash.
